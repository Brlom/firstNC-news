##NorthCoders News

NorthCoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

##URL The site can be accessed on the following URL:

https://brl-nc-knews.netlify.com

##REPO

The Front End repository can be accessed at https://github.com/Brlom/FE2-NC-News The Back End repository can be accessed at https://github.com/Brlom/BE2-NC-Knews

##Getting Started

Run 'npm -i' to install all npm packages. Once installed run 'npm start' to view the website on localhost:3000

##Basic Use

Users must log in before viewing articles. The user can either choose to browse articles by topic or go directly to all articles. Once logged in a user is able to post a new article. A user is also able to see a list of other users and their individual profile page.  

Individual articles can be voted- or commented on. Both the articles and the comments can be deleted. 

##Login

The website has no password authentication and a user can login using one of the following usernames (which can also be found on a drop-down box underneath the user entry):

-jessjelly -happyamy2016 -grumpy19 -tickle122 -cooljmessy -weegembump

##Still needing to be done

- Login: I want to make the dropdown clickable so the user can choose their username.
- Query sort is not functional.
- New topics can be added via article submit, but these do not show up on the topics page. 
- User cannot logout.
- The date is not showing as it should on articles posted via article submit. 
- Deletes can be done by any user, not just the user who published the article/comment.
- Comments up- and downvote function needs to be fixed. 
- Error-handling.
- CSS
- Component clean-up: I want to create more re-usable components similar to 'ArticleSummary.jsx'
